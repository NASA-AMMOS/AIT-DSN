# Usage:
#   python cltu_api_test.py
#
# SSPSim Config:
# 1. Open "MISSION MANAGERS" >  "Test" > "FCLTU - PLOP1"
# 2. Open "PRODUCTION" > "TestBaseband2"
# 3. Activate the production interface by clicking the
#       green arrow labelled "TC"
# 4. Activate the Mission Manager interface by clicking the
#       green arrow labelled "SVC"
# 5. Set dsn.sle.version in config.yaml to the desire version to test (4 or 5). See note below for expected behavior.
#
# Run the script per the usage instructions above. You should see
# logging informing you of the various steps in the script. If all
# runs as expected you should see confirmations back from the sim
# indicating which cltu id was last processed. These will also be
# mirrored in the sim GUI where you'll be informed when a particular
# cltu id has been successfully radiated.
#
# NOTE: If the version is set to 4, this test should print a ValueConstraintError
# (after the finally block) when sending the throw event. This is because the V4 throw-event
# event qualifier has a max length is 128. If the class replacement from v5 to v4 doesn't work (or version is set of 5),
# this test will finish without errors.
