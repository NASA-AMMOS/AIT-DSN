    - !Field
      name: sequence_count
      desc:      |
        Sequential count which numbers each packet on a Logical Data Path,
        i.e. a separate counter is maintained for each source-destination
        pair.

      name: packet_length

        Sequential count which expresses the length of the remainder of the
        packet including checkword if present. The value is the number of
        bytes (octets) following the field minus 1.
      bytes: [4, 5]

    - !Field
      name: time_coarse
      desc: |
        The Time Code is made up of a preamble field (P-field) and a time
        field (T-field). For ISS, as allowed by the CCSDS Recommendation,
        the P-field is implicitly conveyed (it is not present with the
        T-field). ISS time is referenced to GPS Time (midnight 5-6 January
        1980). The T-field consists of 4 octets of coarse time and 1 octet of
        fine time. These octets are a set of binary counters, cascaded with
        the adjacent counters. The value represents the elapsed time since
        midnight 5-6 January 1980. The least significant bit (LSB) of the
        least significant octet of coarse time is equal to 1 second.
      bytes: [6, 9]
      type: TIME32
    - !Field
      name: time_fine
      desc: |
        The LSB of the fine time octet is equal to 2-8 second, or about 4 ms.

      type: TIME8
    - !Field
      name: time_id
      desc: |
        The time field is always present. This field indicates its use.
        Commands with Time ID = 00 indicate real-time commands (RTC) which are
        not authenticated, e.g., commands originating from the Orbiter. Cmds
        with ID = 01 are RTC commands for which authentication is required,
        e.g., commands to the USOS from the SSCC. Commands with ID = 10 are
        stored in the C&C MDMs time-tagged command queue for later execution.
        For Data Packets, the field is always 01 and the time fields contain
        the time at the beginning of the processing frame when the packet was
        generated.

    - !Field
      name: checkword_indicator
      desc: |
        This field indicates if a checkword (add without carry checksum) is
        contained in the CCSDS packet. When present, the checkword is the last
        16-bit word of the packet. All commands must contain a checkword. Data
        packets do not contain a checkword.
