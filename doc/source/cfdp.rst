AIT's CFDP Implementation
=========================

The CFDP (CCSDS File Delivery Protocol) defines a standard for space-to-ground, ground-to-space, and space-to-space file transfer, which may be initiated by the file sending or receiving entity. This documentation of AIT's CFDP implementation assumes some familiarity with the `CFDP standard <https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/727x0b4.pdf>`_.
